http library
http client library and http fetcher will follow later.
http request parsing is also left for soon.

mhttp.m will be renamed to http.m later, after i have replaced a
previous version locally.

to use, make a "mkconfig" (symlink/bind the one from your inferno install
here) and "mk install".
